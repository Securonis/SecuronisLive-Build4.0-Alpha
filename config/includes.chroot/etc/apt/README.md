# Securonis APT Notice

Securonis is configured to use the official Debian global repositories.

For security and privacy:
- Do NOT add third-party repositories.
- Avoid adding country-specific mirrors. Although country mirrors are technically safe, they can leave a geographical fingerprint and might sometimes lag behind the global repositories.

The choice is yours. However, Securonis is not responsible for any errors or delays caused by using different mirrors.
